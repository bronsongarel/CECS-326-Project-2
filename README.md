# CECS-326-Project-2

The following c file implements our version of the dining-philosophers problem using a giude found at https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dining-philosopher-problem-using-semaphores/.  The file implements multiple functions in order to simulate an environment in which multiple philosophers are dining with a fork to their left and right.  When a philosopher picks up two forks, they are able to eat.  As well, the program will display multiple things during the projects runtime.  These include: how long the philosopher eats/thinks and ate/thought, and which fork(s) the philosopher is returning.  The project is built through the terminal usinng the following commands:

```.../Navigate to file```

```.../gcc -o dining dining.c -lpthread```

```..././dining```
